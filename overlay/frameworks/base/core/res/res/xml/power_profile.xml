  <!-- Most values are the incremental current used by a feature,
       in mA (measured at nominal voltage).
       The default values are deliberately incorrect dummy values.
       OEM's must measure and provide actual values before
       shipping a device.
       Example real-world values are given in comments, but they
       are totally dependent on the platform and can vary
       significantly, so should be measured on the shipping platform
       with a power meter. -->
